#  Determinants of CO₂ Emissions in Argentina (1990–2021)

###  Overview
This Power BI dashboard analyzes the **relationship between economic growth, energy use, globalization, and carbon emissions** in Argentina between 1990 and 2021.  
It transforms econometric results (ARDL framework) into a **dynamic visual analytics tool** for exploring sustainability and policy implications.

---

##  Objectives
- Visualize historical trends in **CO₂ emissions**, **GDP per capita**, **renewable and non-renewable energy**, and **globalization**.  
- Examine the **Environmental Kuznets Curve (EKC)** — how economic growth influences emissions.  
- Assess **energy efficiency**, **carbon productivity**, and **decoupling** between GDP and CO₂.  
- Provide **policy-relevant insights** toward sustainable economic development.

##  Data Description
| Variable | Description |
|-----------|--------------|
| **CO₂ per capita** | Carbon dioxide emissions per person (tons CO₂/person) |
| **GDP per capita** | Constant 2015 US dollars — indicator of economic growth |
| **Renewable Energy (%)** | Share of total final energy consumption from renewable sources |
| **Non-Renewable Energy (%)** | Share of energy consumption from fossil fuels |
| **Globalization Index (KOF)** | Composite measure of economic, social, and political openness |
| **Total Energy Consumed** | Sum of renewable and non-renewable energy shares |

##  Key Performance Indicators (KPIs)
| KPI | Description | Policy Relevance |
|------|--------------|------------------|
| **Emission Intensity (CO₂/GDP)** | CO₂ emitted per unit of GDP | Tracks environmental efficiency of growth |
| **Energy Intensity (Energy/GDP)** | Energy used per unit of GDP | Indicates economic energy efficiency |
| **Renewable Share (%)** | Renewable portion of total energy use | Measures energy transition progress |
| **CO₂ per Energy Unit** | CO₂ emitted per total energy use | Captures carbon intensity of energy mix |
| **Carbon Productivity (GDP/CO₂)** | GDP generated per ton of CO₂ emitted | Reflects economic return per emission |
| **Globalization-Adjusted Emissions (CO₂/GLO)** | Emissions relative to globalization index | Shows impact of openness on sustainability |

##  Insights & Policy Implications
- **Post-2009 decoupling:** Economic growth shows a weaker link to CO₂ emissions.  
- **Low renewable share (<10%)** highlights potential for clean-energy expansion.  
- **Energy intensity** has improved slightly, signaling better efficiency in production.  
- **Globalization** correlates with lower emission intensity, suggesting openness can facilitate cleaner technology adoption.  
- Policymakers can prioritize **renewable investment** and **energy efficiency** to achieve sustainable growth.
